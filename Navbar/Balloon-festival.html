             Our gates open at 06:00 AM!  This is our BIGGEST event of the year, 
             and when large numbers of customers all try to arrive just before showtime, 
             the entry line backs up quickly <b> If you arrive after 12:00 PM 
             you will likely end up waiting in a long line of cars to enter the 
             airfield</b>(the line often extends all the way back onto route 17).

            <li>
                    Ballooning requires very light winds and an absence of thermal 
                    activity to be safe and enjoyable, therefore, most balloons 
                    fly in the early morning and late evening hours.
                </li>
            <li>
                Please plan to come early in the morning and/or stay after 
                the airshow so you can see the splendor of many colorful balloons 
                inflating and lifting slowly into the sky
                </li>
            <li>
                Throughout the day we will make announcements to help 
                keep you informed about the timing of balloon events.
                </li>
            <li>
                Many of the balloon pilots will be giving tethered and/or chartered 
                flights. However, the balloon rides are not sold by the Flying Circus.
                The arrangements for a flight must be made with the balloon pilot 
                and not the Gift Ship attendant.

                Announcements will be made regarding any space available for
