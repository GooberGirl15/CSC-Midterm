            2. When should I plan to arrive for the airshow?
            </h2>
            <p class="arrive">
            Our gates open at 11:00 on Sunday.  
            It is best to arrive well before 1:00 as the line to get in will often 
            back up with late arriving guests just before show time.
            </p>

                3.  How long is the airshow?
                </h2>
                <p class="open-gate">
                    The Airshow starts at 2:30, and runs about 90 minutes, 
                    after the airshow we allow the audience to come on to the airfield and meet the 
                    pilots and other airshow performers for about 30 minutes.
